## Project Summary

Create a comprehensive yoga app that offers a seamless user experience for all levels, from beginners to advanced practitioners. The app should include personalized workout plans based on user goals (e.g., flexibility, strength, relaxation), with a library of video tutorials for various yoga poses and full sessions. It must feature real-time progress tracking, goal setting, and notifications to keep users motivated. A built-in meditation section should provide guided sessions for mindfulness and stress relief. The app should allow users to set reminders for daily practice, include detailed pose instructions, and offer tips for injury prevention. Additionally, integrate a community feature for users to connect, share progress, and join live or on-demand classes. Make the interface intuitive, with smooth navigation, easy-to-follow instructions, and customizable features based on user preferences. Ensure compatibility with wearable fitness trackers for tracking heart rate and calories burned during sessions.
